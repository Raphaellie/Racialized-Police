# Race, Representation and Policing

## Race and Policing in the U.S.

-   **H1**: More representation of whites in local police workforce should lead to more favorable perceptions of police among white residents.

-   **H2**: When local police officers present a stronger white imagery, the occurrence of police violence will be less effective in persuading whites into more skeptical attitudes toward police.

-   **H2a**: The moderation effect of police's white imagery on white response to police violence will be strongest when the cases of such violence are racialized regarding their victims.

## Police Brutality

-   There have been no successful efforts by governmental agencies at either local or federal level to systematically document police-involved homicides.

-   Existing literature addressing police violence has usually turned to data voluntarily collected by advocacy groups, the most used of which is that of Mapping Police Violence project.

-   Drawing data points from other reliable sources of police-involved shootings and collecting its unique data through diverse channels including social media, local newspaper accounts, and police reports, the Mapping Police Violence project has by far the most detailed and accurate record of fatal shootings by police since 2013.
